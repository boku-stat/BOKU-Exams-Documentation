# Introduction 

## What is `R/exams`? 

- Package for R
- Created by Achim Zeileis, Bettina GrÃ¼n, Friedrich Leisch and others 
- Designed for dynmaic and customized creation of exams 

## Why do we use `R/exams`? 

- Goal: Create 200 slightly different versions of 10 review exercises, 4 homework examples and 1 exam **each year** 

- "Skeleton" stays the same, (con)text and numbers are changed randomly 

- Each student gets a different version -> prevents cheating within and between cohorts 

## Basic Concept

# Basic Workflow 

## What is an .Rmd-file? 

- Markdown file, where text, code and other things are combined 

- Contains the "skeleton" which the different versions of the exam are based on 

- Certain aspects are randomized using R code 

## Randomization Process
