# Introduction 

- Write an .Rmd exercise file 
- Use `exams2moodle()` to create XML output 
- Upload the XML file to BOKUlearn 

# What is R/exams? 

- Package for R 
- Intended for dynmaic and costumized creation of exams. 
- While the structure is the same for all, the context and numbers can be automatically changed for each student 
- Different version for each student 

# How are tests created? 

## Basic concept 

![](images/graph_rexams.png) 

## Types of Questions 

- numeric 
- string (text)
- single choice 
- multiple choice 
- etc. 

## Example 1 (numeric) 

![](images/num_moodle.png) 

## Data Generation 

```{r data generation, echo = TRUE} 
library(exams) #exams package needs to be loaded for all functions to be available 

#atomic number of H
n_H <- 1

# Define the molar masses of hydrogen (H) and oxygen (O)
m_h <- 1.008 # molar mass of hydrogen in g/mol
m_o <- 16.00 # molar mass of oxygen in g/mol

# Calculate the molar mass of the water molecule (H2O)
m_h2o <- 2 * m_h + m_o
```

## Answer/Solution 

```{r answers/solutions, results = "hide"}
# Create lists for necessary information
answers <- list()
solutions <- list()
types <- list()
explanations <- list()
tolerances <- list()

# Define Question 1: atomic number of hydrogen
answers[[1]] <- ""  # No answer options needed for numeric questions
solutions[[1]] <- n_H
types[[1]] <- "num" #numeric
explanations[[1]] <- "The atomic number of hydrogen is $1$ because it has one proton in its nucleus."
tolerances[[1]] <- 0  # No tolerance

# Define Question 2: molar mass of water
answers[[2]] <- "" # no answer options needed for numeric questions. 
solutions[[2]] <- m_h2o
types[[2]] <- "num" 
explanations[[2]] <- "The molar mass of H2O is calculated by adding the molar masses of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom."
tolerances[[2]] <- 0.5 # Allow for small rounding errors
```

## The Question Section 

```{.markdown include="examples/example_num.Rmd" start-line=36 end-line=55}
``` 

## The Solution Section 

```{.markdown include="examples/example_num.Rmd" start-line=57 end-line=64}
```

## Meta-information 

- Additional information necessary for conversion

```{.markdown include="examples/example_num.Rmd" start-line=66 end-line=81}
``` 


# `exams2moodle()`

## Important aruments and basic conversion 

- `file`: exercise file paths
- `n`: number of variants per exam 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(exams) 

setwd("path/to/Rmd/files") #change working directory 

exams2moodle(file = "name_of_file.Rmd", n = 10 ) #ouput: xml 
```

## How are they used in Moodle?
