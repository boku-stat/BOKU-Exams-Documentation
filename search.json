It has many statistical applications, but is also used in various other fields. There are many extra packages that can easily be installed from CRAN (Comprehensive R Archive Network), where a lot of packages are maintained.\nDownload R here from CRAN.\nSee how to install R and RStudio.\nHow to install packages like R/exams:\ninstall.packages(\"package_name\") #insert the name of the package instead of package_name\n\ninstall.packages(\"exams\") #install the exams package \nlibrary(exams) #loads the contents of the package to make them available \n\n\nRStudio\nRStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R. An IDE is useful for writing and editing code, as it includes additional windows besides the console where both code and results are printed, such as an editing window, a help page, a viewer for plots and many more. All in all, it makes writing in R more comfortable and helps to keep an overview.\nDownload Rstudio here.\n\n\nR/exams\nThe R/exams package is used for automatically generating and evaluating exams.

In addition there are many additional possibilities, like sampling data, creating graphs, importing pictures etc. which will be discussed later (See section ???????)\n\nDescription of the lists\nThe five necessary lists are questions, solutions, types, explanations and tolerances, which all have the same length, which is equal to the number of questions in the exercise. For example, in an exam with 5 multiple choice questions, the length of the lists is 5.\nDepending on the type and simplicity of the question, some of the lists might not be necessary. (see ??????)\nThe list questions contains the answer options for single choice/multiple choice questions, not the questions itself. The actual questions are written down in the section “Question”. For numeric and string questions, this list contains placeholders ““, since no answer options are given. (more on the types of questions see ??????)\nThe list solutions contains the solutions for all the questions. For numeric questions, that is a number, (e.g: 123), for string questions a string like \"hello world\" is expected. The solution for single & multiple choiche questions is a boolean vector containing TRUE/FALSE. For each answer option, one instance of TRUE or FALSE is needed. For example, a multiple choice question with 5 answer options, where one option (in this case the second answer option) is correct, would have a solution vector like this:\nc(FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE)\nThe list types specifies the type of question for each individual question. Possible values are\n\nnumeric (“num”)\nstring (“string”)\nsingle choice (“schoice”)\nmultiple choice (“mchoice”)\n\nThe optional list explanations contains the feedback that is shown. This can be the complete solutions (it should be then formatted as a list) or additional information like the seed, that was used to create this exercise, session info, etc., which can be written in the “Solution” section. (see ??????)\nThe list tolerances is only necessary for numeric questions, where it is desired to have an interval, in which the solution is accepted as correct, even though the numbers are not perfectly equal. This is important for accommodating rounding differences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nCareful when random generating numbers and setting an (absolute) tolerance interval that is too narrow, then the true solution could lie outside of the tolerance interval.\n\n\n\n\nCreating the lists\nThey are initialized as empty lists, which are later filled with the desired information via sub-setting. see ?????\nquestions &lt;- list() \nsolutions &lt;- list() \ntypes &lt;- list()\nexplanations &lt;- list() \ntolerances &lt;- list()",

When it is set to TRUE the answer options are not always displayed in the same order, for example when creating multiple versions of the same exam. When set to an integer, this determines the number of multiple choice answer options shown. For example, when 6 answer options are available through the list object questions and exshuffle is set to 4, then 4 out of 6 questions (always including the true option(s)) are displayed.\n\n\nexversion\nSpecifies the version of the exam, useful for distinction when altering the .Rmd-file and creating a new set of exercises.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n\nThis is the meta-information of a very simple exam, containing one numeric question, one single choice and one multiple choice question with three answer options, without any automation using the lists and paste().\nexname: homework_1\nextitle: Homework 1: Topic A  \nextype: cloze\nexsolution: 42.1|TRUE|c(FALSE,TRUE, FALSE)\nexclozetype: num|schoice|mchoice\nextol: 0.5|0|0\nexshuffle: TRUE\nexversion: v1\n\n\n\n\n\nExemplary structure of the Meta-information\nBelow is an example of how the “meta-information” section could look with some of the R/exams tags explained above, as well as automatic conversion of the solutions, types and tolerances list to the correct format using paste().\nMeta-information\n================\nexname: Abcde\nextitle: Abcde: topic xyz \nextype: cloze\nexsolution: `r paste(solutions, collapse = \"|\")`\nexclozetype: `r paste(types, collapse = \"|\")`\nextol: `r paste(tolerances, collapse = \"|\")`\nexshuffle: TRUE\nexversion: v1",
