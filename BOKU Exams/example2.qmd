This is an exercise containing two text questions about the periodic table. 

The whole example as an .Rmd-file can be downloaded here: 

{{< downloadthis examples/example_string.Rmd dname="string_example" >}}

After conversion with `R/exams` the exercise looks like this for different output types.

## Creating the List Structure 
This section creates and fills the lists which contain the questions, answers, etc.. The `answer` list is empty, because no answer options are needed for text questions, as they are answered with a string. 

The solution to the question, the type of question, as well as a more elaborate explanation are specified for each question. 

::: callout-warning 
The following code has to be placed within a code chunk in the .Rmd-file. See here ????? 
:::

```{r answers/solutions, results = "hide"}
library(exams)
# Initialize lists for the questions, answers, solutions, types, explanations (tolerances are not needed if there are no numeric questions)
answers <- list()
solutions <- list()
types <- list()
explanations <- list()

# Define Question 1: first element in periodic table?
answers[[1]] <- ""  # No predefined answer for string
solutions[[1]] <- "Hydrogen"
types[[1]] <- "string"
explanations[[1]] <- "The first element in the periodic table is Hydrogen because it has an atomic number of 1."

# Define Question 2: element with the abbreviation O?
answers[[2]] <- ""  # No predefined answer for string
solutions[[2]] <- "Oxygen"
types[[2]] <- "string"
explanations[[2]] <- "The element with the abbreviation O is Oxygen, a crucial element for respiration and water."
```

## Question Section 

The next section contains the question text, including the marked spaces `##ANSWERi##` for the answer fields and a necessary code section, which does some formating which is required for the later conversion. This is markdown text, which will appear bold/italic/etc. after conversion. 

It also includes a code chunk, which converts the `answers` list to the necessary format. 

```{.markdown include="examples/example_string.Rmd" start-line=22 end-line=35}
```


## Solution Section 

In this section, additional information and/or the exact solutions can be given. In this case, the information which is stored in the `explanations` list is pasted here through this code chunk and displayed. 

```{.markdown include="examples/example_string.Rmd" start-line=36 end-line=41}
```

## Meta Information Section 

This contains the meta information needed for conversion. See here ????? 

The "source code" is written in markdown and contains inline R code.
```{.markdown include="examples/example_string.Rmd" start-line=42 end-line=51}
```

If the "code" above is evaluated, the section looks like this: 

```markdown
