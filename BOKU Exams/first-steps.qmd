# Purpose of R/exams

R/exams is used to automatically generate and evaluate exam questions. see here for more info about R and R/exams ?????

At BOKU, it is used by the Institute for Statistics in several courses. Homework, review exercises and exams in the form of paper exams, as well as online quizes on BOKUlearn are all created with R/exams. Currently this is mostly used for (introductory) courses for statistics, however, the application is not limited to statistical applications at all.

This documentation should serve as a basic first introduction and a how-to for anyone interested in using R/exams for teaching their courses at BOKU.

# Using R/exams

## What program and what files are used?

The generation of the exams is happening within RStudio. See [how to install R and RStudio](https://statistik.boku.ac.at/stat-lehre/doku.php?id=statistik_mit_r:rstudio:rstudio_installation:start).

Generally, a structure of folders and files (see template here ????) are used, which all have a specific purpose. For a basic implementation, two types of files are necessary, namely .R-files and .Rmd-files.

.R-files are scripts written in R, where R code is written and evaluated.

.Rmd-files are files written in markdown, a markup language, where it is possible to process normal text, (R) code and other components and generate reports in various formats (pdf, Word etc.) as well as web applications such as HTML pages.

## What is in the files?

The .Rmd-file contains the questions, answers and other necessary parameters for creating the exam (see ????? for more details). These components are created by the person wanting to create an exam, however they need to be written according to a certain structure, see here ?????.

The .R file contains the code, which converts the questions that are written in the .Rmd-file into the actual exam in a certain output format. Several formats are possible, such as .pdf, HTML and .xml for Moodle quizzes. (see ??? for more details) This code is based on the functionality of the R/exams package.

An additonal separate .R-file can contain other R objects, which are then (dynamically) used in exam questions, however this is not a necessary component. For more information about add ons see ????.

## What does the exam look like?

An exam can contain many different types of questions. R/exams is suitable for creating not only calculation questions, but also multiple or single questions, open answer questions (single word or essay questions) or including upload points in Moodle exams. It is possible to use any combination in one exam, eg. two numeric and three multiple choice questions.

insert example ????

R/exams does not only have statistical applications, the look of the exam is entirely customizable. It is also possible to include data, graphs, pictures and other things, see ????.

## How can R/exams prohibit cheating?

With R/exams it is possible to create a (very) large number of different versions of the same exam. (see ???? conversion) Slight automatic alterations lead to an individualized exam for each student. For example, this can be used to be able to use the same materials for different exercise groups or to prohibit cheating by having slighty different questions for each student.

## In what ways can an exam be individualized?

changing text/context/stories

this can also be used for tailoring the exam across programs at BOKU

changing data/numbers

creating a pool of true/false statements -\> randomly drawn

different answer options for single/mutiple choice

## How can the exams be corrected?

Different methods for different output formats

moodle -\> automatic correction, solution imported

pdf: solutions, also possible to scan answer sheets for mchoice schoice

see correction methods moodle ????
