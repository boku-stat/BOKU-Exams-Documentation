-   How to include r markdown chunks (which are not executable)

    -   https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html#source-code

-   include r chunks with visible settings

Writing style (internal)

-   Functions are written with () at the end and in backticks. Example: `answerlist()`

-   Backticks `test` for all R objects. Examples: `questions`, `TRUE`
