-   How to include r markdown chunks (which are not executable)

    -   <https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html#source-code>

-   include r chunks with visible settings

-   README? recommended order of reading documentation

-   If a document contains no R code chunks, the default inline syntax using curly braces, e. g. `` `{r}` ``, will not work. Instead, the engine must be set to knitr in the YAML header like this: `engine: knitr`, and no curly braces must be used in the inline code: `` `r` ``.^[<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/78569518/why-is-r-inline-code-not-executed-in-quarto-in-some-situations>]

Writing style (internal)

-   Functions are written with () at the end and in backticks. Example: `answerlist()`

-   Backticks `test` for all R objects. Examples: `questions`, `TRUE`
