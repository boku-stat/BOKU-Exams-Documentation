This website aims to give an overview of how to use `R/exams` for the creation of exercises. 

Disclaimer: Internal cross-references, marked by ???? are not fully implemented yet. 

### What is R/exams? 

`R/exams` is a freely available package for the software R. 

### What is it used for? 

It can be used to automatically create several different types of exercises, with a large number of possibilites for customization to various output types.

### How does it work? 

For each exercise/exam, there is one .Rmd-file which contains all the questions and their solutions. This file is then converted to the desired output type through a script written in an .R-file. 

It is also possible to includes certain elements, which are sampled randomly for each copy of the exercise so they all slightly differ (in order to prevent cheating for example).

### Short Example 

::: {.panel-tabset}

### Code (.Rmd-file)

Complete code of a basic numeric example, see [here](example1.qmd) for the downloadable file and a detailed explanation of the code. 

::: {.callout-tip title="Numeric Example Code" collapse="true"}
```{.markdown include="examples/example_num.Rmd"}

### Quick Guide (Basic Workflow)

- Create a new R project (optional but advisable)

- Create an .Rmd file or download a (custom) template [here](templates.qmd). 

- Write the questions/solutions into the .Rmd-file in the necessary format (see more on the [structure](structure-Rmd.qmd) and [format](creation-Rmd.qmd)). 

- Create an .R file and write the script for conversion or download the template [here](templates.qmd). 

- Convert the .Rmd to the desired output. 

- For Moodle: upload the output file and import the questions into Moodle.
