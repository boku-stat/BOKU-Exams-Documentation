Question
======== 

The following data was collected from two bread manufacturers. For each manufacturer, `r n` loaves of bread were weighed. The result is the following data table: 

```{r, data table, echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
kable(data)
```

The data can be downlaoded as a .csv-file here: 

[bread_data.csv](bread_data.csv)

![](bread.jpg)

Answer the following questions: 

What is the mean weight of the bread made by manufacturer A? ##ANSWER1##

What is the mean weight of the bread made by manufacturer B? ##ANSWER2## 

Using the function t.test() in R, we can check if the mean weight of the bread differs between the two manufacturerss. Use a signficance level of $\alpha = `r alpha`$

The null hypotheses (H0) is that ##ANSWER3## 

The p-value of the t-test is smaller than $\alpha = `r alpha`$. ##ANSWER4## 

Based on these results, we ##ANSWER5## 

```{r answerlist, echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
#necessary codeblock which creates an answerlist object from the answers list, which is needed for conversion 

answerlist(unlist(answers), markup = "markdown") # answerlist for exams2html/exams2moodle created from answers list
```

Solution 
========

To find the correct solutions, the function mean() and t.test() were used. The correct solutions are: 

```{r solutionlist, echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
# feedback format changed from TRUE/FALSE in a vector to strings "True" and "False"
for (i in 1:length(solutions)) {
  if (types[i] %in% c("schoice", "mchoice")) { # only applicable for schoice/mchoice questions
    explanations[i] <- solutions[i] |> lapply(function(x) ifelse(x, "True", "False"))
  } else {
    explanations[i] <- solutions[i] #explanations are the same as solutions 
  }
}

#creates the explanations list needed for conversion 
answerlist(unlist(explanations), markup = "markdown") # answerlist for exams2html/exams2moodle created from solutions/explanations list -> feedback
```

```{r meta, echo = FALSE, results = 'hide'}

# change solution format from TRUE/FALSE vector to 1/0 string
for (i in 1:length(solutions)) {
  if (types[i] %in% c("schoice", "mchoice")) { # only applicable for schoice/mchoice questions
    solutions[i] <- solutions[i] |>
      unlist() |>
      mchoice2string()
  }
}
```
