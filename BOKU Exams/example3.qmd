This is an exercise containing two single choice questions about molar massses. 

The whole example as an .Rmd-file can be downloaded here: 

{{< downloadthis examples/example_schoice.Rmd dname="single_choice_example" >}}

After conversion with `R/exams` the exercise looks like this for different output types.

## Creating the List Structure  

This section creates and fills the lists which contain the questions, answers, etc.. The `answers` list contains the answer options for the questions. The solution to the question, the type of question, as well as a more elaborate explanation are specified for each question. 

::: callout-warning 
The following code has to be placed within a code chunk in the .Rmd-file. See here ????? 
:::

```{.markdown include="examples/example_schoice.Rmd" start-line=1 end-line=24}
```


## Question Section 

The next section contains the question text, including the marked spaces `##ANSWERi##` for the answer fields and a necessary code section, which does some formating which is required for the later conversion. This is markdown text, which will appear bold/italic/etc. after conversion. 

It also includes a code chunk, which converts the `answers` list to the necessary format. 

```{.markdown include="examples/example_schoice.Rmd" start-line=25 end-line=42}
```

## Solution Section 

In this section, additional information and/or the exact solutions can be given. In this case, there is a more elaborate explanation as a solution for each question. Additionally, the code chunk included below converts the `TRUE` and `FALSE` objects into a more readable format of "True" and "False", however this could be in any other format as well. 

```{.markdown include="examples/example_schoice.Rmd" start-line=43 end-line=62}
```

## Meta-Information 

This contains the meta information needed for conversion. See here ????? 

The "source code" is written in markdown and contains inline R code.

```{.markdown include="examples/example_schoice.Rmd" start-line=64 end-line=72}
```

If the "code" above is evaluated, the section looks like this: 

```markdown
