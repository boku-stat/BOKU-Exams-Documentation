This is an exercise containing two single choice questions about molar massses. 

The whole example as an .Rmd-file can be downloaded here: 

{{< downloadthis examples/example_schoice.Rmd dname="single_choice_example" >}}

After conversion with `R/exams` the exercise looks like this for different output types.

## Creating the List Structure  

This section creates and fills the lists which contain the questions, answers, etc.. The `answer` list is empty, because no answer options are needed for text questions, as they are answered with a string. 

The solution to the question, the type of question, as well as a more elaborate explanation are specified for each question. 

::: callout-warning 
The following code has to be placed within a code chunk in the .Rmd-file. See here ????? 
:::

```{r answers/solutions, echo = FALSE, results = "hide"} 
library(exams)
# Initialize lists for the questions, answers, solutions, types, explanations (tolerances are not needed if there are no numeric questions)
answers <- list()
solutions <- list()
types <- list()
explanations <- list()

# Define Question 1: What does the term "molar mass" refer to?
answers[[1]] <- c("The number of molecules in one mole of a substance",
                                       "The mass of one mole of a substance",
                                       "The number of atoms in one mole of a substance",
                                       "The charge of a mole of ions")
solutions[[1]] <- explanations[[1]] <- c(FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE)  # The second option is correct
types[[1]] <- "schoice"

# Define Question 2: Which of the following is the lightest element?
answers[[2]] <- c("Oxygen", "Hydrogen", "Carbon", "Helium")
solutions[[2]] <- explanations[[2]] <- c(FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE)  # The second option (Hydrogen) is correct
types[[2]] <- "schoice"

```

## Question Section 

The next section contains the question text, including the marked spaces `##ANSWERi##` for the answer fields and a necessary code section, which does some formating which is required for the later conversion. This is markdown text, which will appear bold/italic/etc. after conversion. 

It also includes a code chunk, which converts the `answers` list to the necessary format. 

```{.markdown include="examples/example_schoice.Rmd" start-line=25 end-line=42}
```

## Solution Section 

In this section, additional information and/or the exact solutions can be given. In this case, there is a more elaborate explanation as a solution for each question. Additionally, the code chunk included below converts the `TRUE` and `FALSE` objects into a more readable format of "True" and "False", however this could be in any other format as well. 

```{.markdown include="examples/example_schoice.Rmd" start-line=43 end-line=62}
```

## Meta-Information 

This contains the meta information needed for conversion. See here ????? 

The "source code" is written in markdown and contains inline R code.

```{.markdown include="examples/example_schoice.Rmd" start-line=64 end-line=72}
```

If the "code" above is evaluated, the section looks like this: 

```markdown
