This is an exercise containing two multiple choice questions about the elements of the periodic table. 

The whole example as an .Rmd-file can be downloaded here: 

{{< downloadthis examples/example_mchoice.Rmd dname="multiple_ choice_example" >}}

After conversion with `R/exams` the exercise looks like this for different output types.

# Creating the List Structure 

This section creates and fills the lists which contain the questions, answers, etc.. The `answers` list contains the answer options for the questions. The solution to the question, the type of question, as well as a more elaborate explanation are specified for each question. 

::: callout-warning 
The following code has to be placed within a code chunk in the .Rmd-file. See here ????? 
:::

```{r answers/solutions, echo = FALSE, results = "hide"}
library(exams)

# Initialize lists for the questions, answers, solutions, types, explanations (tolerances are not needed if there are no numeric questions)
answers <- list()
solutions <- list()
types <- list()
explanations <- list()

# Define Question 1: Which of the following elements are metals?
answers[[1]] <- c("Iron (Fe)", "Oxygen (O)", "Aluminium (Al)", "Nitrogen (N)")
solutions[[1]] <- explanations[[1]] <- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE)  # Correct answers: Fe and Al
types[[1]] <- "mchoice"


# Define Question 2: Which of the following elements are metalloids?
answers[[2]] <- c("Silicon (Si)", "Boron (B)", "Helium (He)", "Arsenic (As)")
solutions[[2]] <- explanations[[2]] <- c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)  # Correct answers: Si, B, and As
types[[2]] <- "mchoice"
```

# Question Section

The next section contains the question text, including the marked spaces `##ANSWERi##` for the answer fields and a necessary code section, which does some formating which is required for the later conversion. This is markdown text, which will appear bold/italic/etc. after conversion. 

It also includes a code chunk, which converts the `answers` list to the necessary format. 

```{.markdown include="examples/example_mchoice.Rmd" start-line=22 end-line=40}
```

# Solution Section

In this section, additional information and/or the exact solutions can be given. In this case, there is a more elaborate explanation as a solution for each question. Additionally, the code chunk included below converts the `TRUE` and `FALSE` objects into a more readable format of "True" and "False", however this could be in any other format as well. 

```{.markdown include="examples/example_mchoice.Rmd" start-line=42 end-line=61}
```

# Meta-information Section 

This contains the meta information needed for conversion. See here ????? 

The "source code" is written in markdown and contains inline R code.

```{.markdown include="examples/example_schoice.Rmd" start-line=63 end-line=71}
```

If the "code" above is evaluated, the section looks like this: 

``` markdown
Meta-information

exname: example_mchoice
extitle: metalls and metalloids
extype: cloze
exsolution: `r paste(solutions, collapse = "|")`
