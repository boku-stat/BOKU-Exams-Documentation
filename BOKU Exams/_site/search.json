    "text": "Data Generation\nIn this section of the .Rmd-file, the questions (including answer options for single/multiple choice questions), solutions, the types of questions, explanations and tolerances for solutions are created and stored in list objects for later. In addition there are many additional possibilities, like sampling data, creating graphs, importing pictures etc. which will be discussed later (See section ???????)\n\nDescription of the lists\nThe five necessary lists are questions, solutions, types, explanations and tolerances, which all have the same length, which is equal to the number of questions in the exercise. For example, in an exam with 5 multiple choice questions, the length of the lists is 5.\nDepending on the type and simplicity of the question, some of the lists might not be necessary. (see ??????)\nThe list questions contains the answer options for single choice/multiple choice questions, not the questions itself. The actual questions are written down in the section “Question”. For numeric and string questions, this list contains placeholders ““, since no answer options are given. (more on the types of questions see ??????)\nThe list solutions contains the solutions for all the questions. For numeric questions, that is a number, (e.g: 123), for string questions a string like \"hello world\" is expected. The solution for single & multiple choiche questions is a boolean vector containing TRUE/FALSE. For each answer option, one instance of TRUE or FALSE is needed. For example, a multiple choice question with 5 answer options, where one option (in this case the second answer option) is correct, would have a solution vector like this:\nc(FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE)\nThe list types specifies the type of question for each individual question. Possible values are\n\nnumeric (“num”)\nstring (“string”)\nsingle choice (“schoice”)\nmultiple choice (“mchoice”)\n\nThe optional list explanations contains the feedback that is shown. This can be the complete solutions (it should be then formatted as a list) or additional information like the seed, that was used to create this exercise, session info, etc., which can be written in the “Solution” section. (see ??????)\nThe list tolerances is only necessary for numeric questions, where it is desired to have an interval, in which the solution is accepted as correct, even though the numbers are not perfectly equal. This is important for accommodating rounding differences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nCareful when random generating numbers and setting an (absolute) tolerance interval that is too narrow, then the true solution could lie outside of the tolerance interval.\n\n\n\n\nCreating the lists\nThey are initialized as empty lists, which are later filled with the desired information via sub-setting. see ?????\nquestions <- list() \nsolutions <- list() \ntypes <- list()\nexplanations <- list() \ntolerances <- list()"

It does not create the solutions to the questions (see ?????) and nor is it responsible for assessing/grading questions. Instead it can be used as a reference to review questions or provide feedback. This type of information is created in this section.\nThe solutions list contains the actual solutions to the questions, which are used for deeming an answer correct/incorrect, however these are not directly displayed in this section.\nThe explanations list holds any information that can be possibly given as feedback. This can, but does not have to, include the actual solutions, depending on the type of exam one is aiming for.\n\nActual Solutions as explanations\nThe correct solutions to the questions can be displayed in the appropriate format in the generated output.\nSome solutions need to be converted to a more understandable format before being displayed. The solutions to schoice/mchoice questions are stored as TRUE/FALSE vectors and in the following code chunk they are converted to “True” and “False” strings, which are then displayed as explanations to the schoice and mchoice questions.\nfor (x in 1:length(solutions)) {\n\n  if (types[x] %in% c(\"schoice\", \"mchoice) { \n    explanations[x] <- solutions[x] |> lapply(function(x) ifelse(x, \"True\", \"False\"))\n  } \n  \n  else {\n    explanations[x] <- solutions[x]\n  }\n}\nThen the function answerlist() from R/exams processes the explanations list to adjust it to the format needed for conversion of the .Rmd-file to the desired output.\nanswerlist(unlist(explanations), markup = \"markdown\")\n\n\nOther types of explanations\nIn some cases it can be useful to document the seed used, for example when randomly generating numbers or doing any kind of sampling. Providing this information in the “Solution” section to either students or even oneself, when for example reviewing questions, can ensure reproducibility.\nSee ???? for more information on how to dynamically display R objects (like seeds) in the exam."

Titles can be dynamically generated by embedding R objects in the text to adapt the title based on the exam context. see ?????\n\n\nextype\nSpecifies the type of exam. This is different to the list object types from the “Data generation” section. A very common type is “cloze”, which is a type of exam which contains different types of questions, for example a combination of numeric and schoice questions in one exam. If the exam just contains one type of question, for example only multiple choice questions, then this can be specified as well. see ???? for more information on non-cloze exams.\n\n\nexsolution\ncontains the correct solutions for the exam in the necessary format for the conversion of the .Rmd-file. When more than one question (and therefore more than one solution) is created, all solutions need to be in the order of the questions and separated by “|”. This can either be achieved by manually writing down all solutions or with the following code chunk:\npaste(solutions, collapse = \"|\")\nThe resulting R object needs to be dynmically included in the .Rmd-file (see ?????? for details).\n\n\nexclozetypes\nWhen creating an exam of the type “cloze” (the exam contains different types of questions), the type of each question has to be specified. This information is stored in the list typesfrom above. When more than one question (and therefore more than one type) is created, all types need to be in the order of the questions and separated by “|”. This can either be achieved by manually writing down all solutions or with the following code chunk:\npaste(types, collapse = \"|\")\nThe resulting R object needs to be dynmically included in the .Rmd-file (see ?????? for details).\n\n\nextol\ncontains the tolerances used for the answers to numeric questions. When creating an exam of type “cloze”, the tolerances are stored in the list tolerances. They need to be in the order of the questions with empty interations for questions where tolerances are not applicable, e.g. string questions. For details see ??????? (subsetting the lists). All tolerances need to be seperated by “|”. This can either be achieved by manually writing down all solutions or with the following code chunk:\npaste(tolerances, collapse = \"|\")\nThe resulting R object needs to be dynmically included in the .Rmd-file (see ?????? for details).\n\n\nexshuffle\nCan be a logical or an integer and determines if or how the answer options are shuffled. When it is set to TRUE the answer options are not always displayed in the same order, for example when creating multiple versions of the same exam. When set to an integer, this determines the number of multiple choice answer options shown. For example, when 6 answer options are available through the list object questions and exshuffle is set to 4, then 4 out of 6 questions (always including the true option(s)) are displayed.\n\n\nexversion\nSpecifies the version of the exam, useful for distinction when altering the .Rmd-file and creating a new set of exercises.\n\n\n\nExamplary structure of the Meta-information\nBelow is an example of how the “meta-information” section could look with some of the R/exams tags explained above, as well as automatic conversion to the correct format with paste().\nMeta-information\n================\nexname: Abcde\nextitle: Abcde: topic xyz \nextype: cloze\nexsolution: `\\r paste(solutions, collapse = \"|\")`\nexclozetype: `\\r paste(types, collapse = \"|\")`\nextol: `\\r paste(tolerances, collapse = \"|\")`\nexshuffle: TRUE\nexversion: v1\n????? remove backslashes for execution"
