# Subsetting 

The lists used in the .Rmd to contain the answer options, solutions, etc. can be altered via subsetting. 

The lists can be initialized as empty lists using `list()`

```{r}
questions <- list() 
solutions <- list() 
types <- list()
explanations <- list() 
tolerances <- list()
```

## Accessing Elements 
The different elements of a list can be accessed using two square brackets `[[]]`. 

::: callout-tip 
There are other ways of accessing elements in a list, such as `[]`and `$`, however for simplicity reasons, this documentation focuses on `[[]]`. The other two have their own applications, which are not necessary for using `R/exams` in the way it is described here. 
::: 

For example, this accesses the first element of the `questions` list. 

```r
questions[[1]]
```
Accessing multiple elements: 

```r
questions[[c(1, 3, 5)]] #1st, 3rd, 5th element 

questions[[1:5]] #1st to 5th element 
```

## Assigning and Altering Elements 

When elements are accessed, they can also be altered.

```r
solutions[[1]] <- 5 #first element of the answer list is 5 

solutions[[c(2, 4)]] <- "A" #2nd and 4th answer is "A"

tolerances[[1:5]] <- 0 #Tolerances for all questions are 0. 

```

::: callout-note 
Please note that the examples in this section should only show the necessary syntax and are not taken from a real example.

# Content of the Lists 

Using the example of an exercise containing one numeric and one multiple choice question, this section will explain what type of content is put into the lists. 

## Questions list 

Although this list is named questions, actually the answer options for single/multiple choice questions are contained here. 

The exemplary questions are: 
- What is the correct symbol for gold in the periodic table? 
- Please calculate the standard deviation $\sigma$, when the variance is  $\sigma^2 = 2,59$. 

These questions will be pasted in the **question text section** directly in the .Rmd-file. 

So the three answer options for the single choice question would be for example: "Ti", "Au" and "Ag", which are stored in the `questions` list. 

For the numeric question, no answer options are needed, therefore an empty string `""` is placed there instead. (When creating larger exams with many numeric questions, this can be done automatically for all questions at once, see here ???? )

```r
questions[[1]] <- c("Ti", "Au", "Ag")
questions[[2]] <- ""
```

## Solutions list 

The `solutions` list contains the solutions to the questions. 

```r
solutions[[1]] <- "Au"
soltuions[[2]] <- sqrt(2.59)
```


## Types 

```R 
types[[1]] <- "schoice" 
types[[2]] <- "num"
```
